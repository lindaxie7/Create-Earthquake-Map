# Earthquake_Challenge

## Overview of Project
We have created earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, We would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and we would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and would like to see the data on a third map.

## Results
Here is the "maps" I created: 



## Summary
-Add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

-Add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

-Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.
